## HTML Basics

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements, which are used to enclose different types of content. These elements are the building blocks of web pages, and each has a specific purpose. For example, the `<head>` element is used to contain meta information about the web page such as the title and links to stylesheets, while the `<body>` element contains the visible content of the web page. The `<div>` element is used to group and format content on the page, and the `<p>` element is used to define a paragraph of text. The `<img>` element is used to insert an image into the web page, making it more visually appealing and engaging.

## CSS Basics

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to define the styling and layout of web pages written in HTML. CSS allows developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and update. Some of the most commonly used CSS properties include `color`, which is used to set the color of text, `background-color`, which is used to set the background color of an element, `font-size`, which is used to set the size of text, `margin`, which is used to set the margin around an element, and `padding`, which is used to set the padding within an element.

## JavaScript Basics

JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It can be used to create animations, validate forms, and manipulate HTML and CSS. JavaScript is a powerful tool for developers, as it allows them to create engaging web pages that respond to user input and actions. Some of the most commonly used JavaScript statements include `if/else`, which is used to execute different code depending on a condition, `for`, which is used to loop through a block of code a specified number of times, `function`, which is used to define a block of code that can be reused throughout the program, `alert`, which is used to display a message in a pop-up window, and `console.log`, which is used to output a message to the browser's console. By using JavaScript, developers can create web pages that are both functional and interactive.

## Bootstrap Basics

Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework used to create responsive and mobile-first web pages. It includes pre-designed CSS styles and JavaScript plugins that can be easily added to a web page, saving developers time and effort. Some of the most commonly used Bootstrap components include `navbar`, which is used to create a navigation bar at the top of the web page, `jumbotron`, which is used to create a large header section on the web page, `carousel`, which is used to create a slideshow of images or content, `form`, which is used to create forms for user input, and `button`, which is used to create buttons with various styles and sizes.

This packability of bootstrap make the formation to website to another level with the advanced technology and frame work like sass. Being the formal editor and helper to, it also bring the view of many developer to another level.

Display class which a lot of option, staring from display block to none and inline, Flex work like the default flex property with applying the flex property on the parent element and specifying the effect on the direct child.

Overflow with two option, hidden and visible like the css property, Position with all the default and manipulated property. Shadow are pre-built and light and perfect to use when needed a light but awesome shadow.

The Sizing  and spacing are somewhat the same thing but different approach when they are applied. The sizing are range form the small to the large, while the spacing are somewhat with the margin and padding property with a value form 0 - 5.
